# Control-of-P3DX-and-Mapping
In this project P3DX was controlled via ROS. PID controller was applied for simple point to point navigation.

Kinect was then used to gather data and create a Map (using Occupancy-Grid Mapping), Localisation was done using Particle Filter Algorithm. Data was collected via ROS and Mapping and Localising Algorithms were implemented in MATLAB.

Kindly, read documentation to know more details.
